# Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Hand-Gesture

**Introduction**
Sign language is a vital means of communication for individuals who are hearing or speech impaired. However, the lack of widespread understanding of sign language among the general population often results in communication barriers. To address this challenge, this project focuses on developing a real-time system that can detect and recognize hand gestures used in sign language and convert them into readable or audible formats. The project combines computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning to detect hand gestures captured through a camera and interpret them as corresponding characters or words. This solution can significantly enhance accessibility and foster inclusivity by enabling smoother interaction between sign language users and non-users.

**Project Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to build a system that can:
Accurately detect hand gestures using a webcam.
Recognize and classify the gestures corresponding to sign language.
Translate the recognized gestures into readable text or synthesized speech.
Operate in real-time with minimal latency.

**Project Workflow**
The project progresses through the following stages:

**1. Data Collection**
A dataset of hand gesture images is prepared.
The dataset includes various static and/or dynamic gestures from sign language (e.g., ASL - American Sign Language).
Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve model generalization.

**2. Preprocessing**
Each image/frame is processed to:
Detect and isolate the hand region (using techniques like skin-color segmentation or mediapipe landmarks).
Resize, normalize, and prepare the input for the model.
Eliminate background noise and lighting variations to enhance accuracy.

**3. Model Training**
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or other deep learning architecture is trained on the preprocessed hand gesture dataset.
The model is trained to classify each gesture into a corresponding alphabet or word.
Metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix are used to evaluate performance.

**4. Gesture Detection**
A real-time video stream is captured via webcam.
The hand gesture is detected and passed through the trained model.
The model predicts the corresponding sign language letter or word.

**5. Output Translation**
The predicted output is displayed as on-screen text.
Optionally, the text is converted into speech using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine.
The entire process operates in real-time, providing immediate feedback.

**Technologies Used**
**Languages:** Python
**Libraries/Frameworks:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, MediaPipe, NumPy, matplotlib
**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / PyCharm / VS Code
**Optional:** Pyttsx3 / gTTS (for text-to-speech conversion)
